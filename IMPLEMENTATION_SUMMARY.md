## üîß **Plugin Structure**

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ peer-id-assignment/     # Core identity system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-management/     # Single session enforcement with inactivity monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-moderation/          # Content moderation & flagging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-verification/        # AI-assisted user verification

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stripe-billing/         # Subscription management with Stripe integration
```

## üö® **Content Moderation Flow**

### User Flagging Process
1. User clicks "Flag" button on post
2. Modal opens with 8 violation type options
3. User selects type and provides reason
4. Flag created in database (status: pending)
5. Admin receives email notification
6. Admin reviews and takes action

### AI Flagging Process
1. New post created/edited
2. Background job calls FastAPI service
3. AI analyzes using regex + OpenAI
4. If violation detected, flag created automatically
5. High-severity flags trigger immediate admin alerts
6. Admin reviews and takes action

### Severity-Based Actions
- **Critical (5)**: Delete post + suspend user 30 days
- **High (4)**: Hide post + warn user via email
- **Medium (3)**: Hide post
- **Minor (2)**: Flag for review (post stays visible)

## üìã **Database Schema**
