### 15. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

* **Can I use a private email address?**
  Yes. However, if you sign up with a private email (e.g., Gmail), you must also verify a corporate email as a secondary step to confirm your professional background.

* **What happens if I donâ€™t post within 30 days?**
  You will receive a warning, and may be suspended until you resume participation.

* **Can I invite others to join?**
  Yes, via the referral system. When someone signs up using your email as their referrer, and they pay for a subscription, you'll receive 1 month free. Share your email address with potential members for them to use during signup.

* **Can I use a personal email address?**
  Corporate or professional emails are preferred, but not strictly required. If you sign up with a private email, you must also provide a corporate email for verification. You can change your email later through account preferences, but changing from corporate to private email requires admin approval.

* **How do I delete my account?**
  Submit a deletion request through support. Your data will be permanently removed.

* **How do I report inappropriate content?**
  Click the "Flag" button on any post, select the violation type, and provide a reason. Both AI and human admins review all flags.

* **What happens when I flag a post?**
  Your flag is sent to the admin review queue. Admins will review and take appropriate action based on the violation severity. Your identity remains anonymous in the flagging process.

* **What types of violations can I flag?**
  You can flag posts for: solicitation, personal information, harassment, confidential info, off-topic content, spam, identity leaks, or inappropriate content.

* **What happens if my post gets flagged?**
  Depending on the violation severity: posts may be hidden, you may receive a warning, or in severe cases, your account may be suspended. You'll be notified of any actions taken.

* **Can I change my email address after signing up?**
  Yes, but the process depends on your current email type:
  
  **Corporate â†’ Private Email**: Requires admin approval and additional verification. If you have a corporate email backup on file, the process is faster. If not, admins may require additional verification.
  
  **Private â†’ Corporate Email**: Usually auto-approved after email verification, as this improves your verification status.
  
  **Corporate â†’ Corporate Email**: Requires email verification but is typically auto-approved.
  
  To change your email, go to your account preferences and submit a change request. You'll receive a verification email to confirm the new address.

* **What happens if I change from a corporate to private email?**
  The system will:
  1. Check if you have a corporate email backup on file
  2. If yes: Process with medium risk assessment
  3. If no: Flag for high-risk admin review
  4. Admins may require additional verification or reject the change
  5. You'll be notified of the decision via email

* **How long does email change approval take?**
  - **Auto-approved changes**: Immediate after email verification
  - **Admin-reviewed changes**: 24-48 hours typically
