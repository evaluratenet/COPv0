# README: Circle of Peers Platform

## Overview

Circle of Peers is a private, invitation-based digital forum designed exclusively for verified C-level executives. The platform offers anonymous yet high-trust discussion environments on leadership, strategy, growth, HR, M\&A, and other executive themes.

It addresses the loneliness of leadership by enabling peer-to-peer exchange in a strictly confidential and curated space. Each participant is verified, pseudonymous, and assigned a unique, fixed Peer ID.
